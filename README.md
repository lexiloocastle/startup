#ELEVATOR PITCH

When you're planning a game night, or a party where games will be played, it can sometimes be difficult to choose a game. With Gamescape, you can keep track of the games that your friends and you have already played. This makes it alot easier to choose a familiar game or try out something new if that's your preference. If you've got your eye on a certain game, but aren't sure if it's what you're looking for, you can see which friends have played that game. You'll have someone to ask about the game to get a better idea if it's something you want to invest in. Plus it's just fun to keep track of which games you've played.
